23th September 2014  


2.11.1    
JUST SOME GENERAL INTERNAL FILTERS, METHODS AND ACTION HOOKS ADDITIONS (USER REQUESTS) - NOTHING MAJOR
* added filter - wppizza_filter_order_summary_exclude_item_from_count -  to order summary function (affecting cart and order etc) that lets the total count of items (used for calculating delivery charges on a per item basis ) be filtered  
* added action hook - wppizza_gateway_button_append_{gatewayIdent} - that could be used to print stuff/formfields after a specific gateway button (if not using dropdown for gateway selection) 
* added method to gateway class  - wppizza_gateway_append_formfields - to output/append a passed formfields array suitably html formatted (labels/required/input etc) somewhere (for example i conjunction with  wppizza_gateway_button_append_{gatewayIdent} hook  
* maintenence: load gateway classes and variables conditionally in admin and frontend  
19th September 2014  
 
2.11    
* added 'EXPIRED' ENUM value to wppizza_orders table payment_status field   
* added filter to payment method fieldset "wppizza_filter_paymentmethod_confirmation" on confirmation page that could be used if required  
* added action (wppizza_pickup_toggle,true/false) that runs after selection of pickup/no-pickup selection changes  
* added (missing) filter for menu item meta data in ajax requests "wppizza_filter_loop_meta_ajax,$meta,$id" that - most probably - would be used in conjunction with "wppizza_filter_loop_meta,$meta,$id"  
* added some more gateway functions for ease of use in future gateway development    
* added option that forces the user to confirm or cancel (rather than just clicking ok) when changing from pickup to delivery and vice versa  
* added third argument ($items) to relevant do_action hooks in "wppizza-show-order.php" template  
* maintenance/internal: as per gettext/wp guidelines loading textdomain on init as opposed to in __construct  
* more consistent saving of userdata sessions  
* made gateway that use overlays for example as opposed to redirect also work when using confirmation page  
* maintenance/internal: some possible phpnotices on first gateway activations/installations fixed  
* WPML: added missing confirmation form strings (on confirmation page if used) to WPML string translation  
* WPML: fixed spinner (updating quantities on order page) not displaying in secondary languages when using WPML  
* WPML: customer value labels (telephone, address etc for example ) are also now being sent/shown in the right language in emails and on thankyou pages etc  
* WPML: automatically register all relevant gateway extensions settings in wpml string translation  
* WPML: maintenance/internal: eliminated (wpml related) variable that more or less duplicated all the option data (should help memory consumption somewhat)  
* WPML: maintenance/internal: changed registration and translation of wpml strings to automatically register any gateway strings and only load those on order page (saves a few unnecessary queries on some pages)   
* WPML: maintenance/internal: using if(function_exists('icl_translate')) BEFORE including wpml related files to avoid unnecessary file access calls  
* WPML: maintenance/internal: using require_once (as opposed to require) if possible/appropriate for wpml includes (mainly admin registration of wpml strings) to reduce database queries  
* WPML: Note: this whole WPML thing is getting a bit unwieldy/messy now and should at some point be re-factured (However, that's quite a big job, so no ETA yet, as it all seems to work for the time being)
